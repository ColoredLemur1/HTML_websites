        <h2>Tags</h2>
        <p>tags are the essence of html and they use the ">" symbols</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>In HTML all documents must start with document type declaration "!DOCTYPE html" and then do the sections</p>
        <p>These are sections that must have an opening and a closing tag and the first one is always "html" and "/html" then goes the head and then the body which are open and closed respectively ex: </p>
        <img src="htmlstrc.png" alt="structure" style="width: 200px; height: 500;" class = "center">
        <hr>
        <h2>Information attributes</h2>
        <p>In HTML to add information that cannot be hardcoded into the html script it can be added using information attributes</p>
        <p>Hyperlinks can be added using the "href" attribute by using the "a" tag</p>
        <p>so can images, and code and other external data can be added using the "src" attribute under the "image" or "script" tag</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Headings and paragraphs</h2>
        <p>Headings and paragraphs is how HTML websites are structured it is a basic format where the title is displayed and then information follows, this can be divided into sections but ultimately they follow the same structure</p>
        <p>This is done by using the "h1","h2",etc and "p" tags h for headings which go in order of importance with 1 being the biggest and p for paragraphs</p>
